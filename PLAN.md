# Solution Plan: React UI for RAG Data Ingestion API

## Overview
Build a modern, responsive React TypeScript application that provides a comprehensive user interface for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Data Ingestion API. The UI will enable users to upload documents, manage them, view processing status, explore document chunks, and perform semantic search queries.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Upload documents with optional metadata (title, description, tags)
- List all documents with pagination support
- View individual document details and processing status
- Delete documents
- Trigger document reprocessing
- View document chunks
- Perform semantic search queries across all documents
- Display API health status

### Technical Requirements
- TypeScript for type safety
- React 18+ with modern hooks
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states for all async operations
- Clean, modern UI with good UX principles
- Source code organized in `src/` directory
- Integration with all API endpoints from api-spec.yml

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Clean, maintainable code following React best practices
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Proper TypeScript types matching API schema
- Accessible UI components
- Fast initial load and responsive interactions

## Approach

We will use a modern React stack with:
- **Vite** for build tooling (fast, modern, optimized)
- **React Router** for navigation between views
- **Fetch API** for HTTP requests (simple, built-in)
- **CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS** for styling (modern, maintainable)
- **React Hook Form** for form management (document upload, search)
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety

The architecture will follow a clean component structure:
- API client layer for all backend communication
- TypeScript interfaces matching OpenAPI schema
- Reusable UI components
- Page-level components for main views
- Custom hooks for data fetching and state management

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation

      - Development commands
      - Build and deployment
      - API configuration
      - Features overview with screenshots

## Risk Considerations

- **API availability**: Mitigation: Mock API responses during development, clear error messages when API is unavailable
- **File upload size limits**: Mitigation: Add client-side file size validation, display limits to users
- **Browser compatibility**: Mitigation: Use Vite's browser targets, test on major browsers
- **State management complexity**: Mitigation: Start with component state, add context/state library only if needed
- **Type safety gaps**: Mitigation: Strict TypeScript config, validate all API responses

## Testing Strategy

1. **Manual Testing**: Test all user flows in browser during development
2. **Component Tests**: Use Vitest + React Testing Library for critical components
3. **Type Checking**: Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
4. **Build Testing**: Verify production build works correctly
5. **Cross-browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
6. **Responsive Testing**: Test on mobile, tablet, desktop viewports

## Success Criteria

The solution will be considered complete when:

1. All API endpoints are integrated and working
2. Users can upload documents with metadata
3. Users can view, filter, and paginate document lists
4. Users can view document details and chunks
5. Users can delete documents
6. Users can trigger document reprocessing
7. Users can perform semantic searches and view results
8. All features have proper loading and error states
9. UI is responsive across device sizes
10. Code follows React and TypeScript best practices
11. Application builds successfully for production
12. README documentation is complete
13. Core user flows have test coverage

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1 (Setup): 1-2 hours
- Phase 2 (Components): 1-2 hours
- Phase 3 (Documents): 3-4 hours
- Phase 4 (Search): 1-2 hours
- Phase 5 (Navigation): 1 hour
- Phase 6 (Polish): 2-3 hours
- Phase 7 (Testing/Docs): 2-3 hours

**Total**: 11-17 hours for a full-featured implementation
